# Beginner Solar System Planning Checklist

### Solar Panels

- [ ] Are they the appropriate voltage for your system, especially if you're using a PWM charge controller?
- [ ] Is the combined amperage lower than your charge controllerâ€™s input rating?
- [ ] Do you know where and how you are mounting them (roof, ground, pole, rack)?
- [ ] Do you have a spot that gets enough direct sun for most of the day?
- [ ] If using multiple panels, are you wiring them in series, parallel, or series-parallel to achieve the desired voltage and amperage?
- [ ] What size and type of wire do you need to connect them to the charge controller (consider voltage drop)?
- [ ] Have you tested the panels with a multimeter before connecting them?
- [ ] Do you have proper fusing or a breaker between the panels and the charge controller?

### Charge Controller

- [ ] Do you know if your charge controller is PWM or MPPT?
- [ ] Do you know how to set or change the battery type and charging profile (AGM, lithium, flooded, etc.)?
- [ ] Is your charge controller rated for the total voltage and current coming from the solar panels?
- [ ] Do you have a place to mount the controller with adequate ventilation (not in a sealed box)?
- [ ] Have you planned appropriate wire size between charge controller and battery bank?
- [ ] Are you using a fuse or circuit breaker between the controller and the battery?

### Battery

- [ ] Do you know the battery chemistry (lead-acid, AGM, lithium, etc.)?
- [ ] Do you understand the recommended Depth of Discharge (DoD) for your battery type?
- [ ] Is the battery sized properly for your expected daily power use and backup needs?
- [ ] Do you know the proper charging voltage settings for your battery chemistry?
- [ ] Do you have a safe place to install the battery (dry, ventilated, out of extreme heat or cold)?
- [ ] Are you protecting the battery bank with fuses or breakers?
- [ ] Are your batteries secured against tipping, sliding, or vibration?

### Inverter (if using one)

- [ ] Is the inverter rated for the maximum load you expect to run?
- [ ] Is it a Pure Sine Wave inverter if you plan to run sensitive electronics?
- [ ] Have you sized the wire and fuse properly between the battery and inverter?
- [ ] Do you have a manual shutoff switch for the inverter for safety?

### Wire Sizing and Protection

- [ ] Have you calculated the correct wire size for each part of the system based on current (amps) and distance (voltage drop)?
- [ ] Are you using stranded wire (not solid) for DC circuits to prevent fatigue and breakage?
- [ ] Are all your critical circuits fused or protected with circuit breakers close to the power source?
- [ ] Are you labeling your wires and connections for easier maintenance later?


### System Safety

- [ ] Are you using properly rated fuses or breakers for each part of the system (panels, controller, batteries, inverter)?
- [ ] Do you have a disconnect switch or method to shut down the system in case of emergency?
- [ ] Have you checked that all connections are tight, clean, and corrosion-resistant?
- [ ] Are you protecting battery terminals from accidental short circuits (covers, boots, etc.)?
- [ ] Do you have basic fire protection nearby (such as a fire extinguisher rated for electrical fires)?


### Other Important Considerations

- [ ] Have you estimated your daily energy usage and matched your panel size and battery bank to meet it?
- [ ] Are you planning for expansion if you think you'll add more panels or batteries later?
- [ ] Have you allowed space for ventilation around batteries, inverters, and charge controllers?
- [ ] Do you know how to monitor your system (basic meters, battery monitors, or smartphone apps)?
